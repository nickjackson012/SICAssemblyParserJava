This project (SICAssemblyParser) is a commandline driven implementation of an
Assembly Code file parser that can be used for the SIC System Software described 
in the textbook System Software by Leland L. Beck, 3rd Edition. 
The project was developed and tested in IntelliJ 2024.3.2.2 using JDK 23.
It has not been tested on any other IDE. Examples of the Assembly Code that was 
used in testing can be found in the Assembly Code folder. The parser will supply 
the label, operand, and opcode for each line of code and will identify errors 
with the format of the Assembly Code. I pursued this project in an attempt to 
get more familiar with Java and object oriented programming.
